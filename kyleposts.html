            <p>- This photo was taken on the fourth floor of our school while I was looking at the sky. It was a calm moment where I had time to reflect and breathe despite a busy school day. Simple moments like this often become my golden memories.</p>

            <p>- This photo was taken after our chemistry class when our entire class successfully created a wide-range homemade pH indicator. It was a proud moment for all of us because our teamwork and effort paid off. Moments like this remind me that learning becomes more meaningful when shared with classmates.</p>
