            <p>Hello! My Name is<span class="highlight2">Kyle</span>, <span class="highlight2">15 years old</span>a student from <span class=highlight2">Sta. Elena who enjoys spending time with friends,</span> whether through online games, outdoor activities, or singing. <span class="highlight2">I like trying new and challenging things</span> because they help me grow and discover more about myself. I also enjoy sharing experiences from our class and school life.<br>
I <span class="highlight2">created this blog</span> to share my <span class="highlight2">journey and the golden memories</span> I’ve made along the way. I was once someone who did not care much about school, people, and often focused on negative thoughts. But because of <span class="highlight2">God, everything changed.</span> He helped me see life differently, appreciate school, think positively, and want to help others. This blog is a reminder of how growth, faith, and experiences <span class="highlight2">can truly transform a person.</span>
