            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to kyla’s quiet corner, a small space where I share little pieces of my life—my favorite songs, hobbies, foods I love, school-day stories, and the daydreams that keep me inspired. This blog &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is made up of simple joys and quiet thoughts, written slowly and honestly, like notes saved for moments when everything feels a little too loud.

                Here, you’ll find lists of things that feel like me— &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comfort playlists, dream countries, everyday favorites, and reflections from my school life. Nothing here is perfect or rushed; it’s just a gentle journal of who I am and what I love. Feel free to stay, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scroll, and enjoy the calm—this corner is always open.</p>
                
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I let myself pause and breathe, turning ordinary moments into something worth remembering. Each post is a quiet reflection—sometimes soft and nostalgic, sometimes bright and curious—but &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always sincere. This corner isn’t about impressing anyone; it’s about feeling seen, even in the smallest details. I hope that as you read, you find a bit of comfort, familiarity, or inspiration to create &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your own quiet space too.</p>

            <h3>♬⋆.˚ My Music Taste ၊၊||၊</h3>
            
            <p>𑣲 -- I’m really not sure about my favorite music yet—I don’t think I have just one genre or sound that I always stick to. My taste changes depending on my mood, the day, or what I’m feeling at the moment. But I do find myself listening to songs like “double take” and “Statue”.</p>

            <span class="highlight"><p>⋆.˚ double take ˎˊ˗ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⋆.˚ Statue ˎˊ˗</p></span>
            
             <p class="left">▸ “double take” is about realizing feelings for someone you’ve known for a long time, often a close friend. The song talks about that moment when you suddenly see someone differently and start questioning whether the connection is still just friendship or something more. It explores confusion, hesitation, and the fear of risking a friendship by admitting romantic feelings.
            </p>
            
            <p>▸ “Statue” is about feeling emotionally stuck in a relationship where one person is giving more than the other. The song uses the idea of being a “statue” to describe someone who feels ignored, taken for granted, or left waiting while the other person pulls away. It focuses on emotional distance, unreturned effort, and the pain of loving someone who doesn’t fully see you anymore.
