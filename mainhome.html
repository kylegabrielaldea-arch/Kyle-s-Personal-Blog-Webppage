        <h3 class="subh">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;👋Welcome!</h3>
        
            <p> - Welcome to Kyle’s Golden Memories, a personal blog created to capture meaningful moments from my school life and time spent with friends. From quiet reflections on the fourth floor while looking at the sky, to loud laughter during class activities and games, this blog is a collection of memories that made my days special and unforgettable. - </p>
                
            <p> - Each photo here tells a story—celebrating teamwork after successfully creating a homemade pH indicator in chemistry class, enjoying the excitement of our Ati-Atihan festival performance, sharing fun challenges during our Christmas party, and bonding over meals at Mang Inasal. I created this blog to keep these experiences alive and to remind myself that the best memories are often made with the people around us. - </p>

            <h3>𝄞𝄢 Dramamine 𝄞⨾𓍢ִ໋</h3>
            
            <p> - There’s this one song I listen to every time I want to remember my golden memories, and that song is “Dramamine.” The sound and mood of the song remind me of moments with my friends, school experiences, and simple days that felt peaceful and meaningful. Listening to it makes me feel nostalgic and helps me remember how those moments shaped who I am today. - </p>
