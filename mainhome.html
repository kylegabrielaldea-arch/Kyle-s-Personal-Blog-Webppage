            <p>Welcome to Domain Expansion: Kyle’s Blog, a personal space where my everyday life is inspired by the world of Jujutsu Kaisen. This blog is a mix of creativity, fun, and self-expression—from anime references to real moments captured through photos. Whether it’s experimenting with looks, enjoying trips, or simply appreciating small moments, everything here reflects who I am.</p>
                
            <p>This blog also serves as my creative outlet. The images you’ll see include playful edits inspired by characters like Sukuna and Gojo, snapshots from school and city adventures, and moments from cultural celebrations like the Ati-Atihan festival. I created this blog to share my interests, tell stories through pictures, and turn ordinary experiences into something memorable—welcome to my domain.</p>

            <h3>♬⋆.˚ My Music Taste ၊၊||၊</h3>
            
            <p>𑣲 -- I’m really not sure about my favorite music yet—I don’t think I have just one genre or sound that I always stick to. My taste changes depending on my mood, the day, or what I’m feeling at the moment. But I do find myself listening to songs like “double take” and “Statue”.</p>

            <span class="highlight"><p>⋆.˚ double take ˎˊ˗ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⋆.˚ Statue ˎˊ˗</p></span>
            
             <p class="left">▸ “double take” is about realizing feelings for someone you’ve known for a long time, often a close friend. The song talks about that moment when you suddenly see someone differently and start questioning whether the connection is still just friendship or something more. It explores confusion, hesitation, and the fear of risking a friendship by admitting romantic feelings.
            </p>
            
            <p>▸ “Statue” is about feeling emotionally stuck in a relationship where one person is giving more than the other. The song uses the idea of being a “statue” to describe someone who feels ignored, taken for granted, or left waiting while the other person pulls away. It focuses on emotional distance, unreturned effort, and the pain of loving someone who doesn’t fully see you anymore.
